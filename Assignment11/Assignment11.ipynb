    "2. The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to treat data with different accuracy within the same inversion and to identify bad data. Ideally you should have an accurate error estimate on every measurement but mistakes can often occur that can ruin the inversion. Data have been generated using the formula $y = ax + b$, and subsequently contaminated by i) adding Gaussian noise, and ii) changing 3 of the $y$ values so that they are no longer consistent with the original Gaussian noise distribution. You have to identify the 3 bad values and remove them, then obtain best estimates of $a$ and $b$. The data are in a file called `prac3.mat`, in variables `x,y,sig`.  \n",

    "b) How many obviously bad data can you see?  \n",
    "c) Remove them, but only if you are absolutely sure that they are bad. Find a new straight line fit and plot it against the data.  \n",
    "d) Can you see any more obvious bad data? If so remove them. Now weight the data: noise was simulated by adding normally distributed numbers with a standard deviation $σ = 1, 2, 1, 4$ repeated in cycles; this is contained in the variable `sig`. Construct a diagonal weight matrix $\\textbf{C}_e^{-1}$ from the variable `sig` in the data file (ie, discard the equivalent points, then use the Matlab diag function and assume the data are independent). Invert for a straight line again and plot it against the data.  \n",
    "e) Now can you see any bad data? If not, construct the weighted residual vector $\\hat{e} = \\textbf{C}_e^{-1/2}(\\textbf{d} − \\textbf{Am})$ and look for any residuals that are significantly greater than 1. Remove the last bad datum and do one final weighted inversion to estimate the parameters $a$,$b$ (the actual values are 2,5)."
