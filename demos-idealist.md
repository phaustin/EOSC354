# List of ideas for stand-alone concept demos: dashboards or Jupyter notebooks.

This list to be maintained as ideas emerge. Include "found" facilities that are
opensource, restricted or commercial. Also include just "ideas" of apps that we
could build ourselves.

1. Demonstrate Fourier construction of periodic signals
   1. build square, sawtooth, and others one signal component at a time.
2. Exploring complex numbers: exponential and trig forms, graphical relation
between the two, relationship to fourier series ...
3. Tutorials:
   1. [Complex numbers](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-complex-numbers) at Kahn Acadamy, or a shorter intro [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-complex-numbers/alg-polar-form-of-complex-numbers/a/complex-number-forms-review?modal=1). Also Eulerâ€™s formula derived [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-series-new/bc-10-14/v/euler-s-formula-and-euler-s-identity).
   2. [Signals and systems](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-signals#ee-fourier-series) (including fourier) also at Kahn acadamy
4. Interactive intro to [Fourier transforms](https://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/):. We don't necessarily want to use or emulate this one, but it is kinda cool, and maybe inspirational.
5. [Frequencey and the FFT](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/elegant-scipy/9781491922927/ch04.html); Ch. 4 in the O'Reilly book "[Elegant SciPy](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/elegant-scipy/9781491922927/)", as a J-notebook (not live, but in Python, and we could of course use parts for inspiration.)
